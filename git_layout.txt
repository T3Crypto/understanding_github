Welcome to the Git Layout file!

This file is used to define the layout of the git system. Essentially, it is a roadmap of what the git system looks like.

To create a git system, you will need to create a github account.

To create a github account, you will need to go to github.com and create an account.

The git system is a tree structure, with the root node being the root of the git system. Each node in the tree is a directory, and each leaf is a file.

To create a remote repository that appears online, you will go through...

1. The working station
2. The staging area
3. The local repository
4. The remote repository
